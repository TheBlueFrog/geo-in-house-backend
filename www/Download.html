	<h4>GeoFenceService Download and Installation</h4>
	Distribution is being handled via the PlayStore as an invite-only Alpha
	test. If you want in contact me.
	<p>All data is stored on the SD card (or emulated SD card) so
		nothing is lost across uninstall-reinstall.
	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>The build and data stream GUID are displayed on the top of
			the settings page.</li>
		<li>Auto-sync with the servers is working, this uploads any
			collected data, downloads and merges any server-side fences and can
			download some functional updates.
	</ul>
